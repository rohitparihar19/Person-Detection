# Person-Detection

The real-time detection of humans is emerging as a significant trend, to successfully detecting a person in an image or video means you are building an application that will do object detection and image classification.The Detectron 2 model by Facebook is a object detection framework which is implemented in pytorch. It lets you detect objects in image data is a little different than the popular visual classification tools currently being used across many industries. 

# The How and What of Human Detection

What can you accomplish applying object detection tools to your images and video? Computer vision person detection accomplishes three distinct tasks:

1.Picks objects out of background images,
2.Proposes the objects as belonging to a certain class — humans, in this case — using a probability score,
3.Defines the boundaries of the proposed people with x-y origins and height and length values.

# Detectron 2

Detectron2 originates from Mask R-CNN benchmark, and Some of the features of detectron2 comes with are as follows:

1.It is Powered by Pytorch deep learning framework,
2.Panoptic segmentation,
3.Include Densepose,
4.Provide a wide set of baseline results and trained models for download in the Detectron2 ModelZoo,
5.Included projects like DeepLab, TensorMask, PointRend, and more,
6.Can be used as a wrapper on top of other projects,
7.Exported to easily accessible formats like caffe2 and torchscript.

# Requirements
Operating System: Linux or macOS,
Python: 3.6+,
Pytorch: 1.5+ & torchvison that matches the Pytorch installation. You can install both together at pytorch.org,
OpenCV for Visualization.
